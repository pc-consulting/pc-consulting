- This is the repository collection of @pc-consulting.
- It is here for what I do, not only related to the FreeBSD ecosystem.
- Please be aware that items in here may or may not yet be commercial, so technical quality and response times may vary widely.
- If you're interested still, despite of all that, please be in touch.
- You could drop me a line at pcc at gmx dot net, for instance.
